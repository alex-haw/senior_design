# Long distance file transfer with lora packet radio
This is a senior design project with the goal of sending files large distances using LoRa. 
The hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and an Adafruit RFM95 Lora Radio. 
The project is currently in the testing stage. 

This project uses the Adafruit RFM9x circuit python library. Before installing this library, circuit python must be installed.

**Installing Circuit Python:** <br>
See [Adafruit Installing Circuit Python](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi)

**Installing the RFM9x circuit python library:** <br>
The installation process for the RFM9x can be found at [here.](https://learn.adafruit.com/lora-and-lorawan-radio-for-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring)

This Guide is for an example project for getting started with LoRa and raspberry pi.<br>
For more info about the RFM9x python library, see [Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM9x.](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM9x) and [Circuit Python's Documentation.](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/rfm9x/en/latest/index.html)
