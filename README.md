# Tests
This is a senior design project with the goal of sending files large distances using LoRa. 
The hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and an Adafruit RFM95 Lora Radio. 
The project is currently in the testing stage. 

This project uses the Adafruit RFM9x circuit python library. Before installing this library, circuit python must be installed.
For istalling circuit python, see https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi
The installation process for the RFM9x can be found at https://learn.adafruit.com/lora-and-lorawan-radio-for-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring which is a guide for a related project.

For more info about the RFM9x python library, see https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/rfm9x/en/latest/index.html and https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RFM9x
