# Long distance file transfer with lora packet radio
This is a senior design project with the goal of sending files large distances using LoRa. 
The hardware consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and an Adafruit RFM95 Lora Radio. 
The project is currently in the testing stage. 

This project uses the Adafruit RFM9x circuit python library. Before installing this library, circuit python must be installed.

**Installing Circuit Python:** <br>
See https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi

**Installing the RFM9x circuit python library:** <br>
The installation process for the RFM9x can be found at https://learn.adafruit.com/lora-and-lorawan-radio-for-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring
This Guide is for an example project for getting started with LoRa and raspberry pi.
